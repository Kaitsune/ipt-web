                <div>
                    <p>With chewy noodles, soaked in delicious pork and dashi broth, Okinawan Soba is a comfort and soul
                        food to many Okinawans. This classic Okinawan noodle soup is a savory mix of umami tastes
                        including tender stewed pork belly, slices of fish cake, chopped green onion, and red pickled
                        ginger.</p>

                    <p>Before traveling to Okinawa, my Okinawan friends here in the US would always tell me how much
                        they missed Okinawa Soba (沖縄そば). They made it sound so delicious that I was starting to miss a
                        dish I had never tried! Okinawa Soba was on the top of my must-try list when I arrived in
                        Okinawa last December, and it of course did not disappoint. I can still remember the taste of
                        the delicious broth, and knew I had to make my own version when I returned home. So I’m
                        featuring my recipe for Okinawa Soba today with you.</p>

                                <br>

                                <li>To Make Katsuo Dashi & Pork Broth</li>
                                <p>Place the pork belly in a large pot and add 4 cups water (or just enough to cover the
                                    meat).</p>
                                <p>Bring the water to a boil. Once boiling, lower the heat and simmer for 3-5 minutes
                                    until you start to see foams and scums floating on the surface. Drain and quickly
                                    rinse the meat and the pot under running water.</p>
                                <p>Place the meat back to the same pot, and add 6 cups water (roughly 2 cups will
                                    evaporate and we’ll need 4 cups stock at the end of simmering). Bring it to a boil.
                                </p>
                                <p>Once boiling, reduce the heat to simmer and cook for 1 hour. Skim off the scum and
                                    foam floating on the surface.</p>
                                <p>Meanwhile, in a small saucepan, add 2 cups water and bring it to a boil. Lower the
                                    heat to simmer and add 1 cup (10 g) katsuobushi (dried bonito flakes). Cook for 15
                                    seconds and turn off the heat. This is katsuo dashi. Set aside to steep a bit more
                                    until it’s ready to use.</p>
                                <p>After 1 hour of simmering, take out the meat and cover it with aluminum foil. Set
                                    aside until the meat is cool enough to cut.</p>
                                <p>Strain the pork broth through a fine mesh sieve and reserve 4 cups into a measuring
                                    cup. You can save the leftover pork broth for Champon or soup (strain and freeze
                                    it). Put the 4 cups of pork broth back in the pot.</p>
                                <p>Strain katsuo dashi through a fine-mesh sieve. Bring the soup broth to a boil.</p>
                                <p>Once boiling, lower the heat and add 2 tsp soy sauce and 1 Tbsp salt. Mix well and
                                    taste the soup broth and see if you need more salt (or soy sauce). Turn off the heat
                                    and cover with a lid. Set aside.</p>

                                <li>To Make Stewed Pork Belly</li>
                                <p>Once the pork belly is cool enough to handle, cut it into thin slices (3-5 mm).</p>
                                <p>In a clean small saucepan, add 2 Tbsp black sugar and 2 Tbsp awamori.</p>
                                <p>Add 2 Tbsp soy sauce and 2 Tbsp water. Mix all together and bring it to a boil. </p>
                                <p>Lower the heat and add the pork belly slices and quickly coat with the sauce.</p>
                                <p>Place the otoshibuta (drop lid) on top of the meat. Cook on low heat for 25-30
                                    minutes until the sauce is almost evaporated. If you don’t want to use the
                                    oOtoshibuta (You can make a homemade otoshibuta with aluminum foil), you will need
                                    to double the sauce ingredients to make sure the pork is covered. With the
                                    otoshibuta, you don’t need too much sauce to season the meat. Otoshibuta also lets
                                    moisture slowly evaporate and helps the sauce liquid circulate as it hits the lid
                                    and goes back down to the sauce.</p>

                                <li>To Assemble</li>
                                <p>Cut the green onion into thin rounds. Slice the fish cake diagonally into thin
                                    slices.</p>
                                <p>Boil the noodles according to the package instructions. I cook slightly less time
                                    than indicated cooking time. Make sure to use hands to separate the noodles before
                                    adding to the boiling water. With chopsticks, constantly separate the noodles in the
                                    water.</p>
                                <p>Pick up the noodles with a fine mesh sieve (or drain the noodles into a colander in
                                    the sink). Make sure the noodles are well-drained so excess water won’t dilute the
                                    soup. Place the noodles in a serving bowl.</p>
                                <p>Pour the pork/dashi soup broth over the noodles. Place the stewed pork belly slices
                                    atop. Top with fish cakes, green onions, and red pickled ginger. Serve immediately.
                                </p>

                                <li>To Store</li>
                                <p>You can keep the toppings and soup in separate airtight containers and store in the
                                    refrigerator for up to 4-5 days and in the freezer for a month. Noodles have to be
                                    prepared fresh before serving.</p>
