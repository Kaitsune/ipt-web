                    <p>What is your favorite ramen topping? For me, it is the perfectly cooked soft-boiled marinated
                        Ramen Egg (Ajitsuke Tamago). But for most people I know, including Mr. JOC, it is the
                        melt-in-your-mouth juicy, tender, and flavorful slices of braised pork belly known as Chashu

                            <ul>
                                <li>Gather all the ingredients.</li>
                                <br>
                                <h4>To Prepare the Pork Belly</h4>
                                <p>Roll up the pork belly, making sure one or both ends should have the “bacon” like
                                    appearance, showing the varying layers of meat and fat. If your slab comes with the
                                    skin (rind), it should be removed. Ask your butcher and they may remove it for you.
                                </p>
                                <p>Run some butcher twine under the far end of the log. Tie a double knot to secure the
                                    pork tightly. Make sure you leave about 3 inches (7.5 cm) twine at the end.</p>
                                <p>Wrap around the pork belly 2-3 times around the same area to secure the end. Then
                                    pull the twine to the other end of the pork belly. Wrap around 2-3 times at the end
                                    area to secure before working toward the middle. Each wrap should be a ⅓ inch (1 cm)
                                    in between.</p>
                                <p>Continue wrapping around the pork belly toward the end (where you started). Make sure
                                    it’s wrapped as tightly as possible.</p>
                                <p>Once you reach the end, run the butcher twine under some wraps to hook and go back to
                                    the starting point. Find the 3-inch (7.5 cm) twine you leave behind. </p>
                                <p>Tie a double knot with the long twine and the 3-inch (7.5 cm) twine.</p>
                                <li>To Cut Aromatics</li>
                                <p>Cut off the green part of the long green onion and slice the ginger.</p>
                                <li>To Sear the Pork Belly</li>
                                <p>Heat the oil in a cast iron skillet (or regular frying pan) over high heat. Add the
                                    rolled pork belly in the pan.</p>
                                <p>Sear the pork belly one side at a time, rotating to make sure all sides are nicely
                                    seared.</p>
                                <p>It’ll take about 10-15 minutes all together.</p>
                                <li>To Prepare the Sauce</li>
                                <p>While searing, put all the ingredients for seasonings in a heavy-bottom pot that fits
                                    the chashu.</p>
                                <li>To Simmer Chashu</li>
                                <p>Transfer the seared chashu into the Dutch oven.</p>
                                <p>Bring the liquid to a boil.</p>
                                <p>Once boiling, skim off the foam and scum. Then turn the heat to low/simmer.</p>
                                <p>Put an otoshibuta (drop lid) on top to press the ingredient down. You do not need to
                                    use the regular lid and limit the evaporation by just otoshibuta. If you don’t have
                                    the otoshibuta, you can make it with aluminum foil.</p>
                                <p>Simmer on low heat, and cover with the otoshibuta at all times for the next 2 hours,
                                    rotating chashu every 30 minutes.</p>
                                <p>The sauce has been reduced. After 2 hours, turn off the heat to let cool a little
                                    bit.</p>
                                <li>To Rest Chashu Overnight</li>
                                <p>Once the meat is slightly cooled, transfer to a container or plastic food saver bag.
                                    Strain the leftover cooking liquid over a fine-mesh strainer. The liquid is roughly
                                    2 ½ cup.</p>
                                <p>Add ½ cup of the cooking liquid into the bag.</p>
                                <p>Seal the bag with food saver. <b>TIP</b>: Fold a piece of paper towel to plug the
                                    entry of the Food Saver bag. This paper towel will absorb all the moisture when you
                                    seal.</p>
                                <p>I also made a quick ramen egg (ajitsuke tamago) with the leftover liquid. You make
                                    soft-boiled eggs and add ½ cup of cooking liquid in the bag. Cover the cooking
                                    liquid and store chashu, ramen egg, and the cooking liquid in the refrigerator.</p>
                                <h3>Day 2</h3>
                                <p>Open the bag of chashu.</p>
                                <p>Cut the twine with kitchen shears and remove them completely.</p>
                                <p>Slice the chashu into ¼ inch pieces (Keep the edge for chashu fried rice!).</p>
                                <p>Place the chashu slices on a ceramic plate and use a propane torch or broiler to sear
                                    the chashu slices to enhance the flavor. Then enjoy them immediately or serve on
                                    your ramen.</p>
                                <p>Scoop up the solidified fat from the cooking sauce.</p>
                                <p>Prepare a mason jar or container and strain the sauce over a fine-mesh sieve to make
                                    sure the solidified fat is left behind. The sauce will last for a month in the
                                    refrigerator. I use it for drizzling over the chashu and making stir-fries,
                                    marinade, and ramen eggs.</p>
                                <li>To Store</li>
                                <p>You can store the chashu in the refrigerator up to 7 days and 1 month in the freezer.
                                    I usually divide the rolled chashu into thirds and freeze 2 portions separately (for
                                    Ramen right away, and chashu fried rice and chashu Don for later). Ramen eggs should
                                    be consumed in 3-4 days if they are soft-boiled eggs and 7 days if hard-boiled eggs.
                                    The eggs get salty as you keep in the marinade, so remove from the sauce when they
                                    have the right taste.</p>
                                <br>
                                <li>FOR NON-ROLLED CHASHU</li>
                                <p>Gather all the ingredients. For small blocks of pork belly, you don't need to roll
                                    them up before cooking and simmering time is just 1 hour (instead of 2 hours). </p>
                                <p>Heat the oil in a cast iron skillet (or regular frying pan) over high heat. Sear the
                                    fat side down first, then flip over to sear all sides, which will take about 10
                                    minutes.</p>
                                <p>While searing, put all the ingredients for seasonings in a heavy-bottom pot (or
                                    regular pot) that fits the chashu. Add the chashu and bring it to a boil, skimming
                                    the scum and foam. Then turn the heat to low/simmer.</p>
                                <p>ut an otoshibuta (drop lid) on top to press the ingredient down and limit the
                                    evaporation. If you don’t have an otoshibuta, you can make it with aluminum foil.
                                    Simmer on low heat for the next one hour, rotating chashu every 15 minutes (keep
                                    otoshibuta on all times!).</p>
                                <p>After one hour, there is ½ inch liquid left in the pot. Now you have 2 options.
                                    Option 1: If you're serving right away, remove the otoshibuta and further cook down
                                    the sauce on low heat until the sauce gets thicken and see the bottom of the pot
                                    when you draw a line with a spatula. <b>Option 2</b> (recommended): Transfer the
                                    chashu to a container or a bag with a little bit of cooking sauce and refrigerate
                                    overnight. Strain the leftover cooking sauce and refrigerate.</p>
                                <p>To serve, slice the chashu into ¼ inch pieces. You can use a propane torch or broiler
                                    to sear the chashu slices to enhance the flavor. If you kept the chashu overnight
                                    and don't want to sear the chashu, you can reheat it by soaking in the hot cooking
                                    sauce.</p>
