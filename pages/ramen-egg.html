                    <p>There seems to be a ramen craze sweeping the US lately. No, I am not referring to the instant
                        ramen packages you find in the grocery store aisles. I am referring to the fresh ramen noodles
                        served in a delicious hot broth the chef has been preparing for days, topped with sliced chashu
                        (stewed pork), veggies, and a ramen egg.</p>

                            <h3>Instructions</h3>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Gather all the ingredients. Increase the marinate ingredients if you cook more than
                                    4 eggs.</li>
                                <p>In a resealable plastic bag, combine soy sauce, mirin, and water. <b>Tip 1</b>: If
                                    you plan to make the ramen eggs in just a few hours of marinating, use 0-1 Tbsp
                                    water. Otherwise, start with 2-3 Tbsp water and taste before adding more water. You
                                    have to adjust the saltiness to your taste and how long you plan to marinade. <b>Tip
                                        2</b>: To use the minimal amount of the condiments (as we have to discard after
                                    marinating), I use a plastic bag. If you use a container, you will need to double
                                    the amount of condiment to cover the eggs.</p>
                                <p>Bring water to a boil in a medium saucepan. There should be enough water to cover the
                                    eggs (should be 1 inch above eggs).</p>
                                <p>When boiling, take out the eggs from the refrigerator and <b>carefully and slowly</b>
                                    submerge the eggs into the boiling water with a mesh strainer/skimmer or ladle to
                                    prevent the eggs from cracking.</p>
                                <p><b>Immediately reduce heat</b> to maintain a simmer (<b>gentle boil</b>) and cook the
                                    eggs for exactly 7 minutes. [Runny egg yolk - 6 to 6 ½ minutes. Custard-like egg
                                    yolk but not runny - 8 to 9 minutes.] Make sure the water is simmering, but not so
                                    hot that the eggs bounce around. If you want your egg yolk to be in the center,
                                    <b>gently</b> rotate the eggs with chopsticks once in a while for the first 3
                                    minutes so the egg yolk will be in the center. </p>
                                <p>After 7 minutes, immediately take out the eggs and soak in the ice bath to stop them
                                    from cooking further. Let them cool for 3 minutes.</p>
                                <p>The soft-boiled eggs are not completely hardened so <b>gently</b> peel the eggs.</p>
                                <p>Put the eggs in the sauce bag and close tightly. The eggs should be submerged in the
                                    marinade. Let them marinate overnight to up to 3-4 days in the refrigerator. </p>
                                <p>Take out the eggs and cut in halves to serve. Enjoy the eggs by themselves or use
                                    them as a ramen topping. </p>

                                <li>To Store</li>
                                <p>Keep the eggs in the refrigerator all the time. Enjoy the eggs within 4 days if your
                                    eggs are soft-boiled. If your eggs are hard-boiled, you can keep in the refrigerator
                                    for up to a week. For food safety, I recommend discarding the marinade and making a
                                    new batch if you want to make more. </p>
